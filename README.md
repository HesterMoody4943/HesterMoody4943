## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a DevOps student currently exploring Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with a focus on Ansible. This space serves as a learning journal, where I share scripts, playbooks, and small projects as I build practical experience automating infrastructure and managing system configurations.

My main goal is to understand how to create repeatable, reliable infrastructure setups using code. With Ansible, Iâ€™m learning how to write playbooks to automate everything from package installations and service configurations to provisioning virtual machines and deploying applications. Itâ€™s been a powerful way to understand how systems are built and maintained in modern DevOps environments.

This repository includes a mix of hands-on experiments, reusable templates, and notes covering key concepts like idempotency, inventory management, roles, and variables. Iâ€™m also exploring how Ansible fits into broader CI/CD workflows and how it integrates with tools like Docker, Vagrant, and cloud providers such as AWS.

As I learn, I try to follow best practices and write clear, well-documented code that others can understand and build on. Each project is a step forward in understanding not just how to automate tasks, but why automation is essential for scaling infrastructure and improving reliability.

Whether youâ€™re also getting started with Ansible, learning DevOps, or just curious about Infrastructure as Code, feel free to explore the projects, leave feedback, or contribute. Collaboration and community are a big part of this journey.

Thanks for stopping by! I hope you find something here that helps you in your own learning path or sparks new ideas for how to bring automation into your workflow.
